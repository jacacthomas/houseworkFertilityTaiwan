Data cleaning and analysis scripts for the research paper, "Declining Fertility in Taiwan: The Long-Term Deterring Impact of Housework Imbalance", by Jac Thomas (University of Liverpool, UK), Francisco Rowe (University of Liverpool, UK), and Eric S. Lin (National Tsing-Hua University, Taiwan (R.O.C.)).

The repository contains three files. The R script reads in the data from a local directory, then cleans and formats the data, and finally exports the data into a Stata .dat file. The two .do files run analyses on data, for the hybrid models and the cross-sectional models respectively.
